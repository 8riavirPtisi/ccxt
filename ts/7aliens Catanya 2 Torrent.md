The mod was created by Long War Studios, a group of passionate modders who eventually grew to have four core members in charge of the project. They also received help from 29 other contributors who provided various assets and features, 20 voice actors who added more diversity and immersion to the game, and three members of Firaxis Games, the original developer of Enemy Unknown and Enemy Within. The mod's core developer, Amineri, explained that the mod began as a simple tweak to the base game's configuration file, where they adjusted some values and settings. However, as the team learned more about the game's engine and code, they started to make more ambitious and complex changes. By the end of the mod's development, the team had access to the Unreal Development Kit and had developed their own Java-based tool to help them manage the massive amount of changes that the mod introduced.

The mod's main goal was to make the game more challenging and rewarding for experienced players, who felt that the base game was too easy and repetitive. The mod added many new features and mechanics, such as new classes, perks, weapons, items, enemies, missions, maps, and research options. The mod also increased the length and difficulty of the campaign, requiring the player to manage a global resistance against a more powerful and aggressive alien invasion. The mod also added more customization and strategy options, allowing the player to tailor their soldiers and base to their preferred playstyle.
  
The mod was widely praised by fans and critics alike, who considered it one of the best and most comprehensive mods ever made for any game. The mod was also endorsed by Firaxis Games, who invited the mod team to showcase their work at various events and conventions. The mod also inspired Firaxis Games to create XCOM 2, the sequel to Enemy Unknown and Enemy Within, which incorporated some of the ideas and features from the mod. The mod team also collaborated with Firaxis Games to create official mods for XCOM 2, such as Long War 2 and Long War of the Chosen.
  
The mod's legacy and influence can still be seen today, as many players and modders continue to enjoy and improve the mod. The mod has also spawned several spin-offs and submods, such as Long War Rebalance, Long War Perk Pack, Long War Toolbox, Long War Alien Pack, and Long War Overhaul. The mod has also been ported to other platforms and languages, such as Linux, Mac OS X, French, German, Russian, Spanish, Polish, Chinese, Japanese, and Korean. The mod has also received several awards and nominations from various gaming publications and websites.
